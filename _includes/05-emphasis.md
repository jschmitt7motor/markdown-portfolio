*It's Important to know that the star or asterick makes the line bold*

**But if you do two stars instead of one this is what happens**

*JK I was totally wrong, a single star makes it italic and two makes it **bold***

You can also use the _underscore_ to make things __bold__ or _italics_

But what if you just wanted to throw a random under_score in your words does it make_it weirdly italics?
